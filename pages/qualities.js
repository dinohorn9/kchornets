          Creating a Successful Team Culture Our kids are not only chosen on
          their athletic ability, but also their mental ability and inner desire
          to absorb information to improve as an individual and as a team.
          Respectful to our coaches, parents, teammates, the opposing team, game
          officials and the game in general. Showing Sportsmanship by following
          the rules of the game. Treat others as you wish to be treated.
          Teachable, they understand that they have to listen in order to learn.
          When the coaches talk, all eyes and ears pay attention. Good Teammates
          support each other. Being a good teammate is always doing what is best
          for the team and helping each other get better. Their number role — is
          their role being a teammate. Understanding Safety is important for our
          players to learn to prevent mindless injury. Balls, bats and equipment
          can be weapons if one person isn’t paying attention. Positive Mindset
          is a must of our players. They understand they can only worry about
          what they can control. They also know that being upset or angry will
          not fix anything and the it shows immaturity. Drive to improve and
          win. They know success on the field only comes from putting work in
          off the field. A player’s improvement will create success and seeing
          that success will keep the player continuing to improve.
          Zero-Tolerance Policy will be enforced on any form or harassment,
          hazing or bullying between players, coaches, parents or
          administrators. All players should have a sense of belonging to
          something and feeling welcomed.
