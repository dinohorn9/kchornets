          There are many ways to coach that can be successful. We choose to
          coach with positive reinforcement and provide a stress free
          environment to learn in. We also try to keep it fun at practice and
          games. For us, having fun (and improving) is key to keeping the kids
          focus and desire to keep playing. Learning the fundamentals, knowledge
          of “why” an athletic movement is done a certain way and repetition is
          key to our player improvement. At this age we want healthy repetitive
          movements that get ingrained into muscle memory. They will receive
          dedicated coaching from former college athletes and long time coaches.
          We are committed to developing these kids through High School. We
          prefer to keep the same kids so they can develop a great chemistry
          together; with the added security that we are not going to cut them at
          the end of the year.

            Making it fun! Non-Explicit Music at practices. Playing ball should
            be fun and productive. Playing loose and athletic is important. For
            some tournaments we will have walk up music. Look good = feel good =
            play good. Each player will have home and away uniforms. We have
            custom KC Hornet baseball bags and apparel. From helmets, bags,
            apparel and dugout will be branded KC Hornets. Incentives – we have
            stickers to put on the kids helmets for specifics milestones.
