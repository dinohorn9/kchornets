            Since we are an Independent Club Team; which means there is no
            membership fees. The team splits the cost for Indoor Training,
            Outdoor Field Rentals, Tournament Fees and baseballs/softballs. Blue
            Valley Rec League fees go to Blue Valley when the kids sign up in
            the spring. Other than that, the player is responsible for paying
            the cost of the uniform, apparel and bags. All our invoices are
            shared with the parents / guardians. (BB Only)
